DESCRIPTION

TASK 1
The title of the project is "API Integration and Data Visualization." I chose the topic NewsAPI,which is used to collect news articles related to Hyderabad across various categories such as Business, Entertainment, Health, Science, Sports and Technology. 
This retrived data is then analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib in the form of bar chart showing the number of articles per category,I used the requests library to fetch the data and matplotlib. I have learnt how to use these apis to fetch data and
incorporate in the code to get informations. The maain goal of this task is to learn how to connect public APIs and turn the data into something visual and meaningful.

TASK 2 

In this project, I created an automated weather report generator using Python. I used a CSV file with weather data and processed it using pandas. Then, I visualized the weather conditions using a pie chart with matplotlib, and finally, I generated a complete PDF report using FPDF. The report includes a neat table of each state's temperature, humidity, and weather condition, plus a summary of how many states have each weather type. I also added the pie chart into the PDF to make it more visual. The final output is a PDF file and a pie chart image, both saved automatically. To run the project, you just need to install the required libraries and run the Python script with the CSV file in the same folder.

TASK 3 

This chatbot is created for my internship task using Python and NLTK. It's mainly for 12th pass students who want to ask about college details. The bot can answer questions like what courses are available, what is the eligibility, how to apply, what's the cutoff, fee structure, hostel facility, placements, location, and contact info. I made it using keyword matching, so even if someone just types “cutoff” or “fees”, it will understand and give the answer. It runs easily on mobile using the Pydroid 3 app. I just used basic NLTK (no machine learning), and it replies smartly based on the input. This is Task 3 of CODTECH Internship and I’ve written everything in a single Python file. Just run the script, and you can chat with it. It's simple and useful for anyone who wants to know about college.

TASK 4

This project is submitted as Task 4 of my internship, where I developed a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset available in the sklearn.datasets module. I used the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for training the model after splitting the data into training and testing sets. The notebook includes all steps such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a prediction example. The final output provides a clear classification result for a given input, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to assist in basic medical diagnoses.
